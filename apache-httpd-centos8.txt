Today i am going to install Apache webserver and set Custom Port in apache server on CentOS 8. In below scenario i will use port  "8081" to access webserver url.


Q: How to install Apache webserver and set Custom Port in apache server on CentOS 8 ?

Ans:

1. Install the apacher server package named as "httpd" on CentOS 8.

     yum install httpd

2. Verify the httpd server is up and running :
    

     "systemctl status httpd"

3. Now i will customize the port accordingly in the config file.


4. For best practice take backup of config file before modification.

    "cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf httpd.confbkup"

5. Check if the firewall is ON or OFF. If firewall is ON and you need to add entry for Port number which you will define in apache
   webserver. i.e Port 8081
    

     firewall-cmd --state     ------ To check status of firewall.

     firewall-cmd --list-ports         ------------------- To list all the allowed ports. 

     firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8081/tcp --permanent     ------------------ To add port in firewall permanently.

     firewall-cmd --reload      ------------------------------------------------- To restart firewall services
      
     firewall-cmd --zone=public --query-port=8081/tcp       -------------------------  To check  firewall is accepting request or not on port.



6. Then restart httpd service :

       "systemctl restart httpd"

7. Check the httpd service status again: 

    "systemctl status httpd"


8. Now try to access apache webserver using "curl" or using browser. 

   " curl localhost:8081"  
            OR
   " http://192.168.1.152:8081"

9. If above url working fine. It means you have successfully setup the custom port .
